What to keep (good calls)
Animated mascot + highlighted streak pill.
Progress ring for today’s XP vs today’s goal with a celebration on goal reach.
Larger, tappable Quick Log tiles (Food / Activity).
Today’s Journey checklist.
Badges shelf with earned vs locked.
Mobile-first, a11y, reduced-motion support.
Amendments & Improvements (do these)
1) Scope & semantics
Progress ring = today’s XP / today’s goal (not lifetime XP). Show lifetime XP + Level as small text under the ring.
Celebrations (confetti, big mascot) fire only on daily goal completion or new badge unlock—avoid overuse.
2) Server-driven truth (move logic off client)
Milestone detection, combo bonus, and streak logic must be server-side to prevent drift/cheating.
Replace the client condition(logs…) functions with a single summary payload.
GET /api/user/:id/daily-summary (final shape)
{
  "xp_today": 155,
  "xp_goal": 80,
  "streak_days": 3,
  "best_streak": 7,
  "has_food_today": true,
  "has_activity_today": true,
  "milestones": [
    {"id":"fruit1","title":"Log one fruit","reward":10,"completed":true},
    {"id":"activity15","title":"Move for 15 minutes","reward":20,"completed":false},
    {"id":"water","title":"Drink water","reward":5,"completed":true}
  ],
  "badges": {
    "earned": [{"code":"FIRST_FOOD","name":"First Food Log"}],
    "locked":  [{"code":"STREAK_7","name":"One-Week Streak"}]
  },
  "recent_logs": [
    {"id":"a1","type":"food","summary":"🍎 Apple","ts":"2025-09-08T09:10:00Z"},
    {"id":"b2","type":"activity","summary":"⚽ Soccer 30m (😐)","ts":"2025-09-08T17:20:00Z"}
  ]
}
Use user timezone when computing “today”.
3) Milestones (final MVP set)
fruit1 — Log one fruit (emoji or text match) → +10 XP
activity15 — Accumulate ≥15 min activity today → +20 XP
water — Log water today → +5 XP
(Stretch, not now) focus_food based on user goal.
4) Badges (wire to your framework)
Use the seeded badges you defined (e.g., FIRST_FOOD, FIRST_ACTIVITY, STREAK_3/7/14/30, COMBO_DAY…).
Dashboard shows a horizontal shelf; tap → modal with description + “How to earn”.
If badge_awarded appears in any response this session, show a one-time toast + micro confetti here too.
5) Quick Log UX
64×64 tiles, labels (“Apple”, “Soccer”), press bounce.
Taps route to /food-log or /activity-log with query preselects (don’t duplicate log UI in dashboard).
CTA buttons beneath rows: primary 🍎 Log Your Meal, secondary ⚽ Log Activity.
6) Empty & loading states
Skeletons for ring, checklist, badges.
If no badges yet → friendly empty copy (“Unlock your first badge by logging today ✨”).
If no logs today → show “Try one of these quick actions” with two large CTAs.
7) Performance & a11y
Respect prefers-reduced-motion; ring should jump to value.
44×44 min targets, :focus-visible, aria-live="polite" on ring value and checklist updates.
Avoid heavy shadows/filters; cache daily-summary for the session to reduce flicker.
Component checklist (React)
MascotAvatar (props: state: 'idle'|'goalReached'|'badgeUnlocked')
StreakPill (“🔥 Day N”), click opens streak info modal (later).
XPDayRing (props: xpToday, xpGoal, lifetimeXP, level)
QuickLogGrid (food/emojis row, activity/emojis row, routes on tap)
TodaysJourney (renders server milestones[], includes small progress bar completed/total)
BadgesShelf (earned vs locked + modal)
RecentLogsList (last 3–5 entries)
Visual & copy tweaks
Use clear microcopy under ring:
Not met: “155/80 XP today”
Met: “Goal reached! 🎉”
Streak pill copy: “🔥 4-day streak”
Checklist item format: “Move for 15 minutes +20 XP”
Badge modal: “You earned this by logging food and activity on the same day.”
Acceptance criteria (QA list)
Ring animates to xp_today/xp_goal; confetti fires only when crossing the goal threshold (once/day).
Streak pill shows current streak and uses user timezone.
Quick Log tiles route correctly with preselects; buttons are accessible and 44×44+.
“Today’s Journey” reflects server milestones[] and animates completed items (check + strike-through).
Badges shelf shows real earned vs locked; modal opens with title/description; new unlock shows toast + micro confetti.
Recent logs list shows 3–5 latest with emoji/label/time.
All animations honor prefers-reduced-motion. Lighthouse a11y ≥ 90.
Short task handoff to the Agent (copy-paste)
Implement Dashboard/Progress v2 (React)
Add GET /api/user/:id/daily-summary (payload above). Make summary server-driven and timezone-aware.
Build/upgrade components: MascotAvatar, StreakPill, XPDayRing, QuickLogGrid, TodaysJourney, BadgesShelf, RecentLogsList.
Wire Quick Log tiles to /food-log and /activity-log with query preselects.
Add skeletons + empty states; respect reduced motion.
Gate confetti to goal reached and badge unlocked events only.
