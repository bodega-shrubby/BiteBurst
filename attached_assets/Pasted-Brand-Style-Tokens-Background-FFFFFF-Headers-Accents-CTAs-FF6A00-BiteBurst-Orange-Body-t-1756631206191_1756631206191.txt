Screen Structure (top → bottom)
1) Sticky Header
Left: mascot avatar (small) + “Good morning, {displayName}”
Right: Bell (notifications) and settings icons.
Sub-row: Today’s date + “Day X of your streak” (fire icon if >0)
2) Progress Overview (Card)
Two big meters side-by-side:
XP: current day’s XP / daily goal (progress bar, shows +XP on tick)
Streak: current streak (flame icon); tap opens streak detail modal
Micro-interaction: add gentle bounce when XP increases.
3) Goal Snapshot (Card)
Title: “Your goal: {Energy/Focus/Strength}”
Short, one-line AI tip of the day (“Carb + protein = steady energy ⚡”)
Chip buttons to switch goal (does not persist until confirm in modal).
4) Quick Log (Card) — zero friction entry
“Tap, snap, go!” row with:
Food chips (🍎 🥦 🍞 🧃) → opens food logger
Activity chips (⚽ 🧘 🏃 🎯) → opens activity logger
Camera button (photo upload → base64 → send to AI)
After a log, show a toast with XP awarded and one-sentence AI feedback.
5) Today’s Journey (Checklist Card)
3–5 bite-size tasks, e.g.:
“Log one fruit” [ ]
“Move for 15 minutes” [ ]
“Drink water” [ ]
Checking a task adds XP and animates the mascot with a cheer.
6) Badges & Rewards (Card)
Horizontal scroll of earned badges + locked silhouettes.
Tap badge → modal with description and “How to earn”.
7) Leaderboard / Friend Streaks (Card)
Tabs: Friends | Local | Global (default: Friends)
Each row: avatar, name, today’s XP, mini streak flame.
CTA: “Add friends” (opens share/invite modal).
8) Education Bite (Card)
Mini carousel: Food facts + Food→Exercise link
e.g., “Banana + yogurt → great post-practice fuel”.
One swipeable card; stores “seen” state per day.
9) CTA Footer Card (optional)
“Keep your streak alive!” + Log something button (orange).
10) Sticky Bottom Nav (5 icons)
Home (active) | Log | Goals | Badges | More
Large, friendly icons; active uses #FF6A00.
Data Wiring (read-only first, then write)
Use the PostgreSQL schema provided earlier.
Fetch on load (userId in session):
users: display_name, goal, xp, streak
streaks: current, longest, last_active
Today’s logs (count, XP sum)
badges: earned list for carousel
Optional: top 10 friends by today’s XP (mock if not built)
Write paths (called by buttons):
Quick log endpoints (food/activity/photo) → create logs row, xp_events row, update users.xp, streaks, return {xpDelta, feedback}.
Checklist completion toggles → same as quick log but without photo.
Interactions & States
Loading skeletons for all cards (shimmer).
Empty states:
No logs yet → show mascot encouraging message + “Try logging your lunch”.
No friends → simple invite CTA.
Error toasts for failed network/AI calls.
Confetti burst when XP reaches daily target.
Accessibility: 44×44 tap targets, focus outlines, aria-labels on icons.
Assets (placeholders ok; I’ll upload final)
/assets/mascot-biteburst@512.png (small and cheer pose)
/assets/badges/*.png
/assets/icons/* (home, log, goals, badges, more, flame, XP)
Acceptance Criteria
Visual style matches BiteBurst (white background, orange section titles, black body text, rounded cards).
All sections render on mobile with smooth 60fps scroll.
Quick Log flow works end-to-end (UI → API → XP/streak update → UI refresh).
State persists on refresh (reads again from DB).
No blocking UI on API calls; optimistic update for XP (+fallback rollback if error).
Deliverables
Dashboard route /home (default after onboarding).
Components for: Header, ProgressOverview, GoalSnapshot, QuickLog, TodayChecklist, BadgesRail, Leaderboard, EducationBite, BottomNav.
Mock data mode that can run without a server (JSON fixtures) + live mode switched by env flag.
Note
Use Duolingo as layout inspiration only; all characters/mascots must be original BiteBurst art and colors.
