Delta brief — insert 3 new steps after /profile/goal
Placement: Immediately after the existing Goal selection step (/profile/goal).
Steps to add (each on its own screen):
/profile/preferences/fruits

If you use a stepper, extend the total step count accordingly; if you show “Step X of Y,” update Y.
