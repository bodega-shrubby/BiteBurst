Goal: Polish the Home / Progress screen into a motivating, Duolingo-style dashboard. It should highlight XP, streaks, daily goals, badges, and quick logging in a fun, kid-friendly way.
Improvements Needed
Header
Keep greeting (“Good morning, Neeta”) but add a playful mascot animation (wave, jump, sparkle).
Ensure date + streak pill are aligned and styled consistently.
Streak pill should be a highlighted chip (🔥 Day 1 of your streak).
Progress Section
Replace plain circle with a progress ring that animates as XP grows (e.g., “155 XP Today / Goal: 80”).
Show daily goal completion bar (“Goal 80 XP reached!”).
Confetti animation when goal is met.
Keep “Best Streak” but show as a small trophy icon + number.
Your Goal Section
Keep text (“Focus: Sharpen your mind with brain-boosting foods”).
Add a mascot illustration or icon representing the goal.
Use a colored background card (light orange or yellow) to make it stand out.
Quick Log
Group into two rows: Food and Activity.
Use larger emoji cards (64×64, bounce on tap).
Add labels under each emoji (e.g., “Apple”, “Soccer”).
Buttons:
🍎 Log Your Meal (primary orange pill).
⚽ Log Activity (secondary outline button).
Today’s Journey
Show as a checklist card with XP rewards:
Log one fruit → +10 XP
Move for 15 minutes → +20 XP
Drink water → +5 XP
Completed items should animate with a strike-through + green tick.
Progress bar at the bottom (“2/3 tasks completed”).
Badges & Rewards
Replace placeholders with badge icons (earned vs locked).
Earned badges = colorful + mascot cheering.
Locked badges = greyed out with a lock icon.
Horizontal scroll shelf for multiple badges.
Tapping a badge opens a small modal: “You unlocked this by [condition].”
UX & Styling
Mobile-first: max 420px width, 16px padding, rounded cards with shadows.
Colors: white background, orange headers, black body text, grey for secondary.
Animations: confetti for XP/streaks, bounce on emoji tap, smooth progress bar fill.
Accessibility: 44×44 min tap targets, focus-visible, aria-live for progress updates.
Data & API Integration
Pull user state from GET /api/user/:id → { XP, level, streak, badges[] }.
Pull daily logs & XP goal from GET /api/user/:id/daily-summary.
Checklist items should map to log milestones (e.g., fruit logged, activity duration).
Badges shelf should use real badge data from the DB.
Acceptance Criteria
XP progress ring + daily goal bar animate as XP is earned.
Streak pill updates daily and milestone streaks trigger confetti.
Quick Log emojis are tappable, bounce, and route to /food-log or /activity-log.
Today’s Journey checklist tracks completion and shows earned XP.
Badges shelf shows earned vs locked badges with interactive modals.
Screen feels playful, polished, and consistent with FoodLog/ActivityLog screens.
⚡ In short: turn the Home screen into a motivational hub where kids instantly see their XP progress, streak, tasks, and badges — while making logging food/activity just one tap away.
