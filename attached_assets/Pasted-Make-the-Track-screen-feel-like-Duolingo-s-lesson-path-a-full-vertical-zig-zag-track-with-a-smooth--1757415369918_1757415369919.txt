Make the Track screen feel like Duolingo’s lesson path: a full vertical zig-zag track with a smooth SVG path, 8 visible lesson nodes (1 unlocked “START”, 2–3 soon nodes, the rest locked), correct alignment, and playful micro-interactions. What you built is close, but the path is misaligned and the screen feels empty. Let’s ship a polished MVP.
Problems to Fix (from current screenshots)
Path misalignment & fade: the curvy line isn’t centered between nodes and is too light.
Sparse content: only 3 nodes appear; top and bottom feel empty.
Banner card missing affordances: progress card needs icon + CTA hint.
Inconsistent spacing: nodes don’t alternate left/right in a steady rhythm.
Touch target sizes: ensure 56–64px min with 8px focus ring.
Scroll/jump: content height doesn’t fill tall devices; path ends oddly.
Fix all of the above.
Deliverables
A production-ready React screen at /track (or the existing route) that includes:
Header with title + subtitle (already present) and a progress summary card.
A curved SVG path centered between nodes, spanning the full scroll height.
8 nodes (for MVP Week 1): 1 unlocked “START” + 7 upcoming (some locked), alternating left/right, vertically spaced.
Proper states: unlocked, locked, completed, current.
Smooth entrance + hover/tap animations.
Accessibility: keyboard focus, aria labels, reduced-motion support.
Tech & Files
Stack: React + TypeScript + CSS (or Tailwind) used elsewhere. Do not introduce new UI libs.
Create/modify:
src/routes/Track.tsx (or your existing component)
src/components/PathCanvas.tsx (new, renders SVG path)
src/components/LessonNode.tsx (node pill)
src/styles/track.css (or Tailwind classes inline)
Keep design tokens consistent with BiteBurst:
Orange #FF7A00, black #111, gray #EEF1F4 / shadows rgba(0,0,0,.08).
Node ring glow uses soft green for completed, purple for current.
Data Model (mocked)
Use a static Week 1 list for now (can wire later):
type LessonState = 'locked' | 'current' | 'unlocked' | 'completed';

type Lesson = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  icon: '🍎' | '💧' | '🥦' | '🥪' | '⚽' | '🧠' | '😴' | '🏆';
  state: LessonState;
  progress?: number; // 0..1
};

const week1Lessons: Lesson[] = [
  { id: 'L1', title: 'Healthy Snacks',   icon: '🍎', state: 'current'   },
  { id: 'L2', title: 'Hydration Heroes', icon: '💧', state: 'unlocked'  },
  { id: 'L3', title: 'Veggie Victory',   icon: '🥦', state: 'locked'    },
  { id: 'L4', title: 'Smart Sandwiches', icon: '🥪', state: 'locked'    },
  { id: 'L5', title: 'Move & Groove',    icon: '⚽', state: 'locked'    },
  { id: 'L6', title: 'Brain Boosters',   icon: '🧠', state: 'locked'    },
  { id: 'L7', title: 'Sleep Stars',      icon: '😴', state: 'locked'    },
  { id: 'L8', title: 'Weekly Wrap-Up',   icon: '🏆', state: 'locked'    },
];
Compute progress from completed count.
Layout Spec
Container: fixed center column, max-width: 420px (mobile-first), padding: 16px, position: relative.
Progress Card: rounded 16px, subtle shadow; copy:
0 of 8 lessons complete (dynamic) and a subtitle hint: Tap “Healthy Snacks” to start!
Track Area:
Make a tall scrollable column; minimum height so that all 8 nodes fit with breathing room.
Use ~120px vertical spacing between nodes.
Nodes alternate left/right (left: 24px / right: 24px) with the path centered between them.
Reserve 80px top padding before the first node and 160px bottom padding after the last node so the path ends gracefully above the tabbar.
Path Rendering (exact)
Implement a dedicated PathCanvas that receives node anchor points and draws a smooth centerline:
type Point = { x: number; y: number };

function makeSmoothPath(points: Point[]): string {
  // Use cubic Beziers between midpoints for smoothness
  if (points.length < 2) return '';
  const d = [`M ${points[0].x} ${points[0].y}`];
  for (let i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
    const p0 = points[i - 1];
    const p1 = points[i];
    const cx = (p0.x + p1.x) / 2;
    d.push(`C ${cx} ${p0.y}, ${cx} ${p1.y}, ${p1.x} ${p1.y}`);
  }
  return d.join(' ');
}
Anchor calculation:
For each node i (0..7), y = startY + i * 120.
Path x should be midway between left and right nodes with a gentle sway:
x = centerX + Math.sin(i * 0.9) * 14 (small ±14px drift so it feels alive).
Do NOT anchor the path to node centers; it’s a centerline between them.
SVG:
Width = container width, Height = total track height.
stroke: #E2E6EB (a bit darker than now), stroke-width: 8, stroke-linecap: round, fill: none.
Add a faint trailing highlight overlay: same path with stroke-width: 12 + stroke: rgba(255,122,0,0.08).
Node Component (exact)
<LessonNode lesson={...} side={'left'|'right'} y={number} />
Visual spec:
Size: 72px circle (outer) with inner 56px circle, soft shadow.
State styles:
current: purple ring #8B5CF6, “START” pill below (rounded 9999, 12px text), subtle bounce on mount.
unlocked: white ring, label under title; on tap -> scale 0.98 then route to /lesson/:id.
completed: green ring #16A34A, tiny star badge top-right.
locked: gray fill #CBD5E1, lock icon in center, cursor: default.
A11y:
role="button" for tappable states, aria-label="Start Healthy Snacks lesson" etc.
Focus ring: 2px #FF7A00 with outline-offset: 3px.
Positioning:
.node {
  position: absolute;
  width: 72px; height: 72px;
}
.node.left  { left: 24px;  transform: translateY(var(--y)); }
.node.right { right: 24px; transform: translateY(var(--y)); }
(Or set top: y if you prefer; just be consistent.)
Alternating & Spacing Logic
Compute side = i % 2 === 0 ? 'left' : 'right'.
startY = 120 (below the progress card), gap = 120.
For extra polish at large screens, slightly increase gap after every 3rd node: i % 3 === 0 ? gap + 10 : gap.
Progress Summary
Compute: completed = lessons.filter(l => l.state==='completed').length.
Card text: X of 8 lessons complete.
Small linear progress bar under the text (height: 6px, rounded, orange fill).
If completed === 0, show hint: Tap "Healthy Snacks" to start your journey!.
If completed > 0, hint becomes: Great! Keep going to unlock new lessons!.
Interactions & Animations
Entrance: nodes slide/fade from their side (duration: 240ms, stagger 40ms).
Tap (unlocked/current): scale to 0.98 on pointer down, back on up.
Reduced motion: respect prefers-reduced-motion (disable transforms).
Empty Space & Scroll
Ensure the SVG height equals the nodes region height.
Add padding-bottom: 140px so the last node doesn’t get hidden by the tab bar.
Always render all 8 nodes. Locked ones are visible but disabled.
Acceptance Criteria
8 nodes render with alternating sides; first is current with “START” pill.
Curved path is centered between nodes and spans top→bottom smoothly.
Progress card shows X of 8, with a working progress bar and smart hint.
Tapping an unlocked/current node routes to /lesson/:id (stub OK).
Locked nodes are visible, non-interactive.
Screen passes a11y basics: focusable tappables, labels, 44px+ targets.
No empty feel: top and bottom have adequate spacing; no path truncation.
Works at 360–430px widths; looks good at 640–812px heights.
QA Checklist
Resize browser to iPhone SE and iPhone 14 Pro Max emulations.
Keyboard-tab through nodes; focus ring visible and not clipped.
Toggle prefers-reduced-motion and verify animations respect it.
Scroll to bottom: last node is fully visible above the nav bar; path ends cleanly.
Lighthouse a11y ≥ 90.
Nice-to-Have (if time)
Tiny animated sparkle on current node (CSS keyframes).
Confetti burst when a lesson becomes completed (use existing confetti utility if available).
Show a small star marker midway between some nodes, using the lighter gray “bonus” dot from the mock.
Please commit changes in a single PR titled “Track Screen – Duolingo-style path & nodes” with short comments where you compute anchors, so we can tweak spacing easily.
