📋 Replit Agent Instructions — Build Lesson: “BrainFuel for School (KS3)”
Audience: KS3 (11–14)
Format: 6 steps → each has Question, Options, Success feedback, TryAgain1, TryAgain2, Learn card
Mechanics:
XP: +10 per standard step, +15 for matching/ordering
Hearts: −1 on incorrect submission (on CHECK)
Correct → Success page; Incorrect → Try-again banner; 2nd incorrect → Learn card → Continue
STEP 1 — Carbohydrates (slow vs fast energy)
Question: “Which food gives the most steady energy for study or revision?”
Options:
🍬 Sweets (fast spike)
🍞 White bread (quick release)
🍚 Brown rice ✅ (wholegrain, slow release)
🥤 Fizzy drink (spike then crash)
Success: “Correct. Wholegrain carbs (like brown rice, oats, wholemeal pasta) release glucose slowly, keeping focus steady across a lesson.”
TryAgain1: “Think slow & steady fuel, not a quick burst.”
TryAgain2: “Which option keeps blood sugar stable through the lesson?”
Learn card: “The brain uses glucose. Wholegrains release it gradually → fewer dips in focus.”

STEP 2 — Protein & fats (more than muscles)
Question: “Proteins are only for muscles, not the brain. True or false?”
Options: False ✅ / True
Success: “Right. Protein helps build/repair tissues and make brain messengers; healthy fats (e.g., omega-3) support cell membranes and memory.”
TryAgain1: “Your brain also needs building blocks.”
TryAgain2: “Which choice recognises protein’s role beyond muscles?”
Learn card: “KS3 nutrition: protein = growth & repair; fats = energy/structures; both matter for brain function.”

STEP 3 — Match nutrients → brain role (drag & drop)
Question: “Match the nutrient to how it helps you think and learn.”
Pairs to build:
🧠 Omega-3 fats → “Supports memory & learning (cell membranes)”
⚡ B vitamins → “Helps release energy from food for focus”
🩸 Iron → “Carries oxygen to the brain (clear thinking)”
🛡️ Vitamin C → “Helps protect cells (antioxidant)”
Success (show under each pair):
“Omega-3: healthy brain cell membranes → memory.”
“B vitamins: energy release → concentration.”
“Iron: oxygen supply → less tiredness.”
“Vitamin C: protection → healthy function.”
TryAgain1: “Think energy, oxygen, memory, protection.”
TryAgain2: “Which one links to oxygen in blood?”
Learn card: “Omega-3→memory; B vits→energy release; Iron→oxygen; Vit C→protection.”

STEP 4 — Smart exam snack (balance carbs + protein)
Question: “Exam in 1 hour. Best snack for sharp focus?”
Options:
🍫 Chocolate bar (sugar crash)
🍌 Banana + nuts ✅ (carbs + protein + micronutrients)
🥤 Fizzy drink (dehydrating, crash)
🍟 Crisps (fatty, low nutrient)
Success: “Yes. Fruit + nuts give glucose + protein + minerals → steady energy through the exam.”
TryAgain1: “Some choices spike then crash. Which lasts longer?”
TryAgain2: “Pick the one that combines energy and nutrients.”
Learn card: “Smart snacks blend carb + protein + vitamins (e.g., fruit+nuts, yogurt+berries).”

STEP 5 — Digestion & absorption (ordering)
Question: “Put the steps in order to show how nutrients reach your brain.”
Items to order:
Chew food in the mouth
Food broken down more in the stomach
Small intestine absorbs nutrients into blood
Nutrients travel in blood to brain & muscles
Correct order: Mouth → Stomach → Small intestine → Blood
Success: “Exactly. Most absorption happens in the small intestine; blood then delivers nutrients to the brain.”
TryAgain1: “Chew → digest → absorb → transport.”
TryAgain2: “Which organ does the absorbing step?”
Learn card: “Small intestine = main site of nutrient absorption into the bloodstream.”

STEP 6 — Consequences of poor fuelling
Question: “If you often skip breakfast, what’s most likely?”
Options:
💤 Tiredness & poor focus ✅
🏃 Faster running speed
🎧 Better memory
💪 Stronger muscles
Success: “Correct. Low morning glucose → less concentration and slower thinking in lessons.”
TryAgain1: “Skipping meals rarely improves performance.”
TryAgain2: “What happens when the brain’s fuel runs low?”
Learn card: “Breakfast = steady morning energy → better attention and memory in class.”
