Overview
BiteBurst is a web-based MVP designed to help children aged 6–14 build healthy eating and movement habits through a fun, gamified experience. The app uses AI to provide personalized, age-appropriate feedback on meals and activities, while rewarding kids with XP, badges, and streaks to encourage consistency.

The MVP will focus on four key user interactions:

Logging food and activity via emoji, text, or photo.
Selecting personal goals (e.g., Energy ⚡, Focus 🧠, Strength 💪).
Receiving fun, science-backed explanations of how their habits support their goals.
Earning gamified rewards and tracking progress through XP and badges.
The problem BiteBurst solves: Most nutrition and fitness apps are built for adults — they're too technical, not engaging, and fail to connect with kids. BiteBurst makes nutrition fun, motivating, and educational using simple visuals, mascot interaction, and reward-based feedback, making it easier for kids to build long-term healthy habits.

The MVP will be built in Replit, using:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js or Replit's built-in web server
Database: Replit DB
AI: OpenAI API for generating real-time feedback
Image handling: Base64 conversion for photo uploads
The visual and UX style will be inspired by Duolingo — clean layout, scroll-triggered animations, friendly mascots, and engaging micro-interactions. This reference will guide the layout and flow, but all mascots and characters used in BiteBurst are original and designed specifically for the 6–14 age group.

Designs for each homepage section have been completed and will guide the full UI development process.

AI Integration
OpenAI will generate short, fun explanations of how meals or activities support user goals
Prompt will include age, selected goal, and meal or activity data
Example prompt:
"The user is 10 years old with a goal to improve focus. They ate: apple, peanut butter, and yogurt. What’s a fun, kid-friendly explanation of how this helps them in school? Keep it short and age-appropriate."

Image Handling: Base64 Strategy (MVP)
User-uploaded images are converted to base64 strings on the client
Stored temporarily and sent to OpenAI API when needed
Simplifies architecture and avoids external image storage or CDN setup
Ideal for MVP; may evolve to CDN in later versions
UI Design Guidance
Use uploaded homepage and section designs as visual reference
White backgrounds throughout
Consistent use of sliced orange mascot with outlined arms/legs
Black body text and orange headers
Friendly, modern layout inspired by Duolingo (not copied)
Custom age-appropriate characters targeting ages 6–14
Include subtle animations and hover effects for engagement
