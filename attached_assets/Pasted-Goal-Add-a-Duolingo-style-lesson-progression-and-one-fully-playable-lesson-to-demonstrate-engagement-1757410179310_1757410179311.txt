Goal
Add a Duolingo-style lesson progression and one fully playable lesson to demonstrate engagement + gamification. Keep it lightweight, mobile-first, and consistent with BiteBurst (white bg, orange headers, black body, friendly mascot).
Routes
/lessons — Lesson Path (progression map)
/lesson/demo — Demo Lesson (Intro → Quiz → Success → Complete)
After completion, return to /lessons with XP/streak updated.
Tech
React (same patterns as existing routes), headless components + scoped CSS.
Reuse existing XP/streak APIs; if missing, stub and clearly mark TODOs.
No external UI frameworks.
1) Lesson Path ( /lessons )
UI
Header: “Healthy Habits: Week 1”
Vertical path with 4 nodes (mock), each a rounded card with icon + label:
🍎 Healthy Snacks (unlocked, Start button → /lesson/demo)
💧 Hydration Heroes (locked)
⚽ Move & Groove (locked)
🧠 Focus Power-Ups (locked)
Each node shows:
Small XP chip (e.g., “+25 XP”)
Lock/Unlock state
Progress ring (0/1, 1/1) for completion
Floating mascot bubble top-right (waves on first visit).
Data Model (client JSON for MVP)
type LessonNode = {
  id: string; title: string; icon: string; xp: number;
  state: 'locked'|'unlocked'|'complete';
  pathIndex: number;
};
Seed 4 nodes in src/data/lessonTrack.json. On demo completion, mark node 1 complete and unlock node 2.
Behavior
Tapping an unlocked node opens its lesson (only node 1 playable).
After demo completes, update local state (localStorage) and re-render path with:
Node 1: completed check + full ring
Node 2: unlocked with subtle glow
A11y
Nodes are buttons; 44×44 min targets; focus-visible rings; ARIA labels.
2) Demo Lesson ( /lesson/demo )
Flow (4 screens inside one route)
Intro
Card: “Healthy Snacks” (Lesson 1 of 4)
Mascot + short subtitle: “Pick the best snack to power your day.”
Button: Start (+25 XP)
Quiz (single step; Duolingo-style token chooser)
Prompt: “Which of these is a healthy snack?”
Options (pills with emoji + word):
🍎 Apple (correct)
🍫 Chocolate bar
🥨 Pretzel
User taps → immediate feedback:
Correct → card lights green, bounce animation.
Incorrect → shake + micro-hint: “Try one with fiber.”
Success Strip
Appears at bottom like Duolingo: “Nice! 🍎 Apples give long-lasting energy.”
Button: Continue
Lesson Complete
Large illustration (mascot + celebratory pose).
Stats tiles:
Total XP: +25
Good: 100%
Speedy: show elapsed time (optional stopwatch)
Primary CTA: Claim XP → posts XP + streak → navigates back to /lessons?justCompleted=demo.
State & API
type LessonRun = { startedAt: number; finishedAt?: number; correct: boolean };
On Start: record startedAt.
On Claim XP:
POST /api/xp/award { userId, amount: 25, reason: 'lesson_demo' }
POST /api/streak/tick { userId, date: today } (or reuse existing tick)
If APIs missing, create stubs that resolve and update local UI, then TODO to wire later.
Animations
Quiz correct: pill bounce (keyframes) + sparkle burst near pill.
Complete screen: confetti (respect prefers-reduced-motion → fade only).
Path unlock: newly unlocked node glow for 1.2s.
Error/Offline
If XP award fails, show non-blocking toast: “Saved locally; will sync later.” Keep “Claim XP” idempotent by disabling after success.
A11y
Quiz pills are radio buttons (role group) with ARIA feedback on correctness.
Success/Complete announce via aria-live="polite".
Components & Files
src/routes/Lessons.tsx            // path screen
src/routes/LessonDemo.tsx         // orchestrates 4 steps
src/components/lessons/TrackNode.tsx
src/components/lessons/ProgressRing.tsx
src/components/lessons/QuizPills.tsx
src/components/lessons/SuccessStrip.tsx
src/components/lessons/Confetti.tsx
src/data/lessonTrack.json
src/styles/lessons.css            // scoped styles, mobile-first
Styling (BiteBurst)
Colors: orange headers (#FF7A00), black text (#111), gray chips (#EFEFEF), soft shadows, rounded-2xl cards.
Maintain tap target ≥ 44×44; use :focus-visible outlines.
Keep layout within 420px container.
Copy (kid-friendly)
Intro: “Pick the snack that powers you up!”
Correct: “Nice! Apples give long-lasting energy.”
Complete: “Lesson complete! You earned +25 XP.”
Navigation & Persistence
Add “Lessons” to the bottom nav as Track (map icon).
Use localStorage['bb-lesson-track'] to persist node states for the demo.
On returning from /lesson/demo with ?justCompleted=demo, show:
Mascot pop + confetti burst once
Node 2 glow; scroll into view; then remove query param from history.
Acceptance Criteria
/lessons renders 4 nodes; node 1 is playable; others locked.
/lesson/demo runs Intro → Quiz → Success → Complete with smooth transitions.
Claim XP updates XP/streak (stub or real), marks node 1 complete, unlocks node 2, returns to /lessons.
Confetti + glow appear once after completion; respects reduced motion.
All interactive elements keyboard + screen reader friendly; no console errors.
Stretch (only if time remains)
Add a second quiz step (hydration) but keep the flow single-question for MVP.
Add “Try again” state for wrong answer (no penalty).
Show tiny progress bar at top of lesson (1/1).
Please implement exactly as specified, wiring to real XP/streak endpoints if present and falling back to local stubs otherwise.
